<p>1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. </p>
<p>2 Now the
earth was unformed and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep;
and the spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters. </p>
<p>3 And God
said: 'Let there be light.' And there was light. </p>
<p>4 And God saw the
light, that it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness. </p>
<p>5
And God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. And
there was evening and there was morning, one day. </p>
<p>6 And God said: 'Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters,
and let it divide the waters from the waters.' </p>
<p>7 And God made the
firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from
the waters which were above the firmament; and it was so. </p>
<p>8 And God
called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was
morning, a second day. </p>
<p>9 And God said: 'Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together
unto one place, and let the dry land appear.' And it was so. </p>
<p>10 And God
called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters
called He Seas; and God saw that it was good. </p>
<p>11 And God said: 'Let the
earth put forth grass, herb yielding seed, and fruit-tree bearing fruit
after its kind, wherein is the seed thereof, upon the earth.' And it was
so. </p>
<p>12 And the earth brought forth grass, herb yielding seed after its
kind, and tree bearing fruit, wherein is the seed thereof, after its
kind; and God saw that it was good. </p>
<p>13 And there was evening and there
was morning, a third day. </p>
<p>14 And God said: 'Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to
divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for
seasons, and for days and years; </p>
<p>15 and let them be for lights in the
firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth.' And it was so.
</p>
<p>16 And God made the two great lights: the greater light to rule the
day, and the lesser light to rule the night; and the stars. </p>
<p>17 And God
set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,
</p>
<p>18 and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light
from the darkness; and God saw that it was good. </p>
<p>19 And there was
evening and there was morning, a fourth day.
</p>
<p>20 And God said: 'Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures,
and let fowl fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.' </p>
<p>21
And God created the great sea-monsters, and every living creature that
creepeth, wherewith the waters swarmed, after its kind, and every winged
fowl after its kind; and God saw that it was good. </p>
<p>22 And God blessed
them, saying: 'Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the
seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.' </p>
<p>23 And there was evening and
there was morning, a fifth day.
</p>
<p>24 And God said: 'Let the earth bring forth the living creature after
its kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after its
kind.' And it was so. </p>
<p>25 And God made the beast of the earth after its
kind, and the cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth
upon the ground after its kind; and God saw that it was good. </p>
<p>26 And
God said: 'Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let
them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the
air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every
creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.' </p>
<p>27 And God created man in
His own image, in the image of God created He him; male and female
created He them. </p>
<p>28 And God blessed them; and God said unto them: 'Be
fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have
dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and
over every living thing that creepeth upon the earth.' </p>
<p>29 And God said:
'Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is upon the
face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree
yielding seed--to you it shall be for food; </p>
<p>30 and to every beast of
the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that
creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is a living soul, [I have given]
every green herb for food.' And it was so. </p>
<p>31 And God saw every thing
that He had made, and, behold, it was very good. And there was evening
and there was morning, the sixth day.</p>
