<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">1 And the heaven and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">2 And on the seventh day God finished His work which He had made; and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">3 And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it; because that in it He rested from all His work which God in creating had made. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">4 These are the generations of the heaven and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made earth and heaven. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">5 No shrub of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">6 but there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">7 Then the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils  the breath of life; and man became a living soul. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">8 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward, in Eden; and there He put the man whom He had formed. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">9 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life  also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil . </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became four heads. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">11 The name of the first is Pishon ; that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah , where there is gold;</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">12 and the gold of that land is good; there is bdellium  and the onyx stone . </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">13 And the name of the second river is Gihon ; the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Cush . </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">14 And the name of the third river is Tigris ; that is it which goeth toward the east of Asshur . And the fourth river is the Euphrates . </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">15 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">16 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying: 'Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">17 but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">18 And the LORD God said: 'It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">19 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto the man to see what he would call them; and whatsoever the man would call every living creature, that was to be the name thereof. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">20 And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found a help meet for him. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">21 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the place with flesh instead thereof. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">22 And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from the man, made He a woman, and brought her unto the man. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">23 And the man said: 'This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh.</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.</p>
