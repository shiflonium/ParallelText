<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">1 And the man knew Eve his wife; and she conceived and bore Cain , and said: 'I have gotten a man with the help of the LORD.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">2 And again she bore his brother Abel . And Abel was a keeper of sheep , but Cain was a tiller of the ground . </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering;</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">5 but unto Cain and to his offering He had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">6 And the LORD said unto Cain: 'Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">7 If thou doest well, shall it not be lifted up? and if thou doest not well, sin coucheth at the door; and unto thee is its desire, but thou mayest rule over it.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">8 And Cain spoke unto Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">9 And the LORD said unto Cain: 'Where is Abel thy brother?' And he said: 'I know not; am I my brother's keeper?' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">10 And He said: 'What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto Me from the ground. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">11 And now cursed art thou from the ground , which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">12 When thou tillest  the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">13 And Cain said unto the LORD: 'My punishment is greater than I can bear. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">14 Behold, Thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the land; and from Thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth; and it will come to pass, that whosoever findeth me will slay me.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">14 And the LORD said unto him: 'Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold.' And the LORD set a sign for Cain , lest any finding him should smite him. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">16 And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod , on the east of Eden. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">17 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bore Enoch ; and he builded a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">18 And unto Enoch was born Irad ; and Irad begot Mehujael ; and Mehujael begot Methushael ; and Methushael begot Lamech . </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">19 And Lamech took unto him two wives; the name of one was Adah , and the name of the other Zillah . </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">20 And Adah bore Jabal ; he was the father of such as dwell in tents and have cattle. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">21 And his brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">22 And Zillah, she also bore Tubal-cain , the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron ; and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah .</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">23 And Lamech said unto his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech; for I have slain a man for wounding me, and a young man for bruising me; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">24 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">25 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bore a son, and called his name Seth: 'for God hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel; for Cain slew him.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">26 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh ; then began men to call upon the name of the LORD. </p>
