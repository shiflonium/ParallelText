<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">11,1 And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">11,2 And it came to pass, as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">11,3 And they said one to another: 'Come, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly.' And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">11,4 And they said: 'Come, let us build us a city, and a tower, with its top in heaven, and let us make us a name; lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">11,5 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">11,6 And the LORD said: 'Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is what they begin to do; and now nothing will be withholden from them, which they purpose to do. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">11,7 Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">11,8 So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth; and they left off to build the city. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">11,9 Therefore was the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth; and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">11,10 These are the generations of Shem. Shem was a hundred years old, and begot Arpachshad two years after the flood. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">11,11 And Shem lived after he begot Arpachshad five hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.  </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">11,12 And Arpachshad lived five and thirty years, and begot Shelah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">11,13 And Arpachshad lived after he begot Shelah four hundred and three years, and begot sons and daughters.  </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">11,14 And Shelah lived thirty years, and begot Eber. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">11,15 And Shelah lived after he begot Eber four hundred and three years, and begot sons and daughters.  </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">11,16 And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begot Peleg. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">11,17 And Eber lived after he begot Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begot sons and daughters.  </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">11,18 And Peleg lived thirty years, and begot Reu. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">11,19 And Peleg lived after he begot Reu two hundred and nine years, and begot sons and daughters.  </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">11,20 And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begot Serug. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">11,21 And Reu lived after he begot Serug two hundred and seven years, and begot sons and daughters.  </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">11,22 And Serug lived thirty years, and begot Nahor.</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">11,23 And Serug lived after he begot Nahor two hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.  </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">11,24 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begot Terah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">11,25 And Nahor lived after he begot Terah a hundred and nineteen years, and begot sons and daughters.  </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">11,26 And Terah lived seventy years, and begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">11,27 Now these are the generations of Terah. Terah begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begot Lot. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">11,28 And Haran died in the presence of his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">11,29 And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">11,30 And Sarai was barren; she had no child.</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">11,31 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">11,32 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years; and Terah died in Haran. </p>
