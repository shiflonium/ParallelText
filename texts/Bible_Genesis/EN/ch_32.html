<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">32,1 And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them. And Laban departed, and returned unto his place. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">32,2 And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">32,3 And Jacob said when he saw them: 'This is God's camp.' And he called the name of that place Mahanaim. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">32,4 And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the field of Edom. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">32,5 And he commanded them, saying: 'Thus shall ye say unto my lord Esau: Thus saith thy servant Jacob: I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">32,6 And I have oxen, and asses and flocks, and men-servants and maid-servants; and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favour in thy sight.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">32,7 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying: 'We came to thy brother Esau, and moreover he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">32,8 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed. And he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two camps. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">32,9 And he said: 'If Esau come to the one camp, and smite it, then the camp which is left shall escape.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">32,10 And Jacob said: 'O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O LORD, who saidst unto me: Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will do thee good; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">32,11 I am not worthy of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which Thou hast shown unto Thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two camps. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">32,12 Deliver me, I pray Thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, lest he come and smite me, the mother with the children.</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">32,13 And Thou saidst: I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">32,14 And he lodged there that night; and took of that which he had with him a present for Esau his brother: </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">32,15 two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">32,16 thirty milch camels and their colts, forty kine and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten foals. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">32,17 And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself; and said unto his servants: 'Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">32,18 And he commanded the foremost, saying: 'When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying: Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">32,19 then thou shalt say: They are thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord, even unto Esau; and, behold, he also is behind us.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">32,20 And he commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying: 'In this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">32,21 and ye shall say: Moreover, behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us.' For he said: 'I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept me.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">32,22 So the present passed over before him; and he himself lodged that night in the camp. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">32,23 And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven children, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">32,24 And he took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">32,25 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">32,26 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was strained, as he wrestled with him. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">32,27 And he said: 'Let me go, for the day breaketh.' And he said: 'I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">32,28 And he said unto him: 'What is thy name?' And he said: 'Jacob.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">32,29 And he said: 'Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel; for thou hast striven with God and with men, and hast prevailed.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">32,30 And Jacob asked him, and said: 'Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.' And he said: 'Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name?' And he blessed him there. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">32,31 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: 'for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">32,32 And the sun rose upon him as he passed over Peniel, and he limped upon his thigh. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">32,33 Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sinew of the thigh-vein which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day; because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh, even in the sinew of the thigh-vein.</p>
