<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">44,1 And he commanded the steward of his house, saying: 'Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">44,2 And put my goblet, the silver goblet, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money.' And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">44,3 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">44,4 And when they were gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward: 'Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them: Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">44,5 Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby he indeed divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">44,6 And he overtook them, and he spoke unto them these words. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">44,7 And they said unto him: 'Wherefore speaketh my lord such words as these? Far be it from thy servants that they should do such a thing. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">44,8 Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought back unto thee out of the land of Canaan; how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">44,9 With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">44,10 And he said: 'Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my bondman; and ye shall be blameless.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">44,11 Then they hastened, and took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">44,12 And he searched, beginning at the eldest, and leaving off at the youngest; and the goblet was found in Benjamin's sack. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">44,13 And they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">44,14 And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house, and he was yet there; and they fell before him on the ground. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">44,15 And Joseph said unto them: 'What deed is this that ye have done? know ye not that such a man as I will indeed divine?' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">44,16 And Judah said: 'What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants; behold, we are my lord's bondmen, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is found.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">44,17 And he said: 'Far be it from me that I should do so; the man in whose hand the goblet is found, he shall be my bondman; but as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.'  </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">44,18 Then Judah came near unto him, and said: 'Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant; for thou art even as Pharaoh. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">44,19 My lord asked his servants, saying: Have ye a father, or a brother? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">44,20 And we said unto my lord: We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">44,21 And thou saidst unto thy servants: Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">44,22 And we said unto my lord: The lad cannot leave his father; for if he should leave his father, his father would die. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">44,23 And thou saidst unto thy servants: Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">44,24 And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">44,25 And our father said: Go again, buy us a little food. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">44,26 And we said: We cannot go down; if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down; for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">44,27 And thy servant my father said unto us: Ye know that my wife bore me two sons; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">44,28 and the one went out from me, and I said: Surely he is torn in pieces; and I have not seen him since; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">44,29 and if ye take this one also from me, and harm befall him, ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">44,30 Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad is not with us; seeing that his soul is bound up with the lad's soul; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">44,31 it will come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die; and thy servants will bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">44,32 For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying: If I bring him not unto thee, then shall I bear the blame to my father for ever. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">44,33 Now therefore, let thy servant, I pray thee, abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">44,34 For how shall I go up to my father, if the lad be not with me? lest I look upon the evil that shall come on my father.'</p>
