<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">1 Now the serpent  was more subtle than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman: 'Yea, hath God said: Ye shall not eat of any tree of the garden?' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">2 And the woman said unto the serpent: 'Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">3 but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said: Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">4 And the serpent said unto the woman: 'Ye shall not surely die; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">5 for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat; and she gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig-leaves  together, and made themselves girdles. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">8 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden toward the cool of the day; and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">9 And the LORD God called unto the man, and said unto him: 'Where art thou?' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">10 And he said: 'I heard Thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">11 And He said: 'Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">12 And the man said: 'The woman whom Thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">13 And the LORD God said unto the woman: 'What is this thou hast done?' And the woman said: 'The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">14 And the LORD God said unto the serpent: 'Because thou hast done this, cursed art thou from among all cattle, and from among all beasts of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">15 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; they shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise their heel.'  </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">16 Unto the woman He said: 'I will greatly multiply thy pain and thy travail; in pain thou shalt bring forth children ; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.'  </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">17 And unto Adam He said: 'Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying: Thou shalt not eat of it; cursed is the ground for thy sake; in toil shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">18 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken; for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">20 And the man called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">21 And the LORD God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins, and clothed them. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">22 And the LORD God said: 'Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">23 Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">24 So He drove out the man; and He placed at the east of the garden of Eden the cherubim , and the flaming sword  which turned every way, to keep the way to the tree of life. </p>
