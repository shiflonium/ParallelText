<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">43,1 And the famine was sore in the land. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">43,2 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, that their father said unto them: 'Go again, buy us a little food.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">43,3 And Judah spoke unto him, saying: 'The man did earnestly forewarn us, saying: Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">43,4 If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">43,5 but if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down, for the man said unto us: Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">43,6 And Israel said: 'Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">43,7 And they said: 'The man asked straitly concerning ourselves, and concerning our kindred, saying: Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words; could we in any wise know that he would say: Bring your brother down?' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">43,8 And Judah said unto Israel his father: 'Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go, that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">43,9 I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him; if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">43,10 For except we had lingered, surely we had now returned a second time.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">43,11 And their father Israel said unto them: 'If it be so now, do this: take of the choice fruits of the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spicery and ladanum, nuts, and almonds; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">43,12 and take double money in your hand; and the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks carry back in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">43,13 take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man; </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">43,14 and God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release unto you your other brother and Benjamin. And as for me, if I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">43,15 And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">43,16 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house: 'Bring the men into the house, and kill the beasts, and prepare the meat; for the men shall dine with me at noon.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">43,17 And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">43,18 And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said: 'Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="19">43,19 And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they spoke unto him at the door of the house, </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="20">43,20 and said: 'Oh my lord, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="21">43,21 And it came to pass, when we came to the lodging-place, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight; and we have brought it back in our hand. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="22">43,22 And other money have we brought down in our hand to buy food. We know not who put our money in our sacks.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="23">43,23 And he said: 'Peace be to you, fear not; your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks; I had your money.' And he brought Simeon out unto them. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="24">43,24 And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="25">43,25 And they made ready the present against Joseph's coming at noon; for they heard that they should eat bread there. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="26">43,26 And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed down to him to the earth. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="27">43,27 And he asked them of their welfare, and said: 'Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spoke? Is he yet alive?' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="28">43,28 And they said: 'Thy servant our father is well, he is yet alive.' And they bowed the head, and made obeisance. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="29">43,29 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin his brother, his mother's son, and said: 'Is this your youngest brother of whom ye spoke unto me?' And he said: 'God be gracious unto thee, my son.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="30">43,30 And Joseph made haste; for his heart yearned toward his brother; and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="31">43,31 And he washed his face, and came out; and he refrained himself, and said: 'Set on bread.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="32">43,32 And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, that did eat with him, by themselves; because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.</p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="33">43,33 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth; and the men marvelled one with another. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="34">43,34 And portions were taken unto them from before him; but Benjamin's portion was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.</p>
