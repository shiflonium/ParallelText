<p class="bodytextEN" id="1">20,1 And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the land of the South, and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur; and he sojourned in Gerar. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="2">20,2 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife: 'She is my sister.' And Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="3">20,3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him: 'Behold, thou shalt die, because of the woman whom thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="4">20,4 Now Abimelech had not come near her; and he said: 'LORD, wilt Thou slay even a righteous nation? </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="5">20,5 Said he not himself unto me: She is my sister? and she, even she herself said: He is my brother. In the simplicity of my heart and the innocency of my hands have I done this.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="6">20,6 And God said unto him in the dream: 'Yea, I know that in the simplicity of thy heart thou hast done this, and I also withheld thee from sinning against Me. Therefore suffered I thee not to touch her. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="7">20,7 Now therefore restore the man's wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live; and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="8">20,8 And Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears; and the men were sore afraid. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="9">20,9 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him: 'What hast thou done unto us? and wherein have I sinned against thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="10">20,10 And Abimelech said unto Abraham: 'What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="11">20,11 And Abraham said: 'Because I thought: Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="12">20,12 And moreover she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and so she became my wife. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="13">20,13 And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her: This is thy kindness which thou shalt show unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me: He is my brother.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="14">20,14 And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and men-servants and women-servants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="15">20,15 And Abimelech said: 'Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="16">20,16 And unto Sarah he said: 'Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver; behold, it is for thee a covering of the eyes to all that are with thee; and before all men thou art righted.' </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="17">20,17 And Abraham prayed unto God; and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maid-servants; and they bore children. </p>
<p class="bodytextEN" id="18">20,18 For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife. </p>
